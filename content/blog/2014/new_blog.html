	I've been wanting to start fresh with a blog for some time but just haven't gotten around to it.
	I've looked at various options on platforms on and off, but I didn't want to use a hosted solution like Blogger, <b>really</b>
	didn't want to use Wordpress yet again and while I could build one using Grails (and I thought about it often), the time involved
	didn't appeal to me as I had other, better, things to do.
</p>
<p>
	So, I came across Octopress and the GitHub publishing of blogs and thought that was pretty intriguing, but again, the GitHub as the 
	host didn't appeal to me. Eventually I came across <a href="http://jbake.org" target="_blank">JBake</a> and it seemed to fit what I
	was looking for. That was about an hour ago :)
</p>
<p>
	I looked at some of the other blogs and sites mentioned on the JBake site and it seemed pretty nice. Nice simple text file writing which I like, had the ability to use Groovy Server Pages (I'm familiar with) along with ASCIIDoc pages (which I want to learn). I also liked that it is completely static generated so I don't have to run a database or an application. Just generate the content, copy to a server and let the webserver handle it all. Saves resources and is super fast. All in all, I figured why not.
<p>
	I installed it via GVM, initialized my first directory structure, generated the examples pages, did some digging around and here I am, writing this first post. I will probalby migrate a few of my favorite posts from my old blog into here eventually, and maybe add in some non-blog stuff later on like various non-coding projects I do.
