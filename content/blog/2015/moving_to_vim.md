A while back I tried out the Atom editor and while it isn't a bad edit per se, there were two things I just didn't like about it.
The first was the startup time was way too slow. The second was the fuzzy file search kind of sucked. I almost always had to put the entire file name in to get what I wanted. It always seemed to find everything else but what I really needed.

Well, in watching some videos about Ember, I noticed many were actually using vim. This kind of surprised me, but I thought I take a closer look. Now, I'm no stranger to vim, having used it for years, but in a very limited capacity. Basically to just edit config files and such on servers, never as a daily editor.

Going back in time to my Zappos days, I remember when I first got there almost everyone used vi. Now when I first got there the site was built in perl and each dev had their own dev server, so basically they spent their day SSH'd into their dev box doing coding. Only us few Java folks had an IDE (most of the front end devs used TextMate). I remember watching a few of them and damn were they fast. I always remembered that; how quickly they moved around and how efficient they were.

So, fast forward to 2015, I decided to take a closer look. Naturally I hit up YouTube and watched some videos and I was surprised at the number of plugins available and they were the kinds of plugins I would want to use. So I took the leap, cold turkey, and started using it at work a week or so ago. I forced myself to only use vim and nothing else. I install a few plugins like CtrlP, Vundle, airline and a couple others. I also installed iTerm2, and the combination has been quite eye opening to say the least.

I still have a hard time once in a while with managing buffers, and some navigation (like forcing myself to not use the arrow keys), but overall the experience has been pretty positive. So much so that one of my coworkers is also making the switch :)

My daily flow now is to have several split panes open instead of my previous use of tabs. While other editors can to split panes, I never really got into the groove with them, but it seems quite natural in vim. I do have a few annoyances but overall I think I'm going to stay with vim.
